## Position Relative

* Can be used to push the current elements position relative to the current elements natural position.
* If you want this element not to move out of it parent you can set overflow: hidden to its parent.
* This doesn't work for body element though. If you want to use this in body you have to set overflow:hidden to both body and html.
